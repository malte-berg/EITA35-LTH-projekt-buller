    It is harmful for humans to be exposed to high noise levels, especially for a long period of time. Therefore a noise level indicator can be used to prevent excessive noise levels at workplaces or in schools where loud noises are common. In this project, a circuit has been constructed that measures the sound, and lights different colored LEDs depending on the volume. The circuit consists of a microphone, high-pass filter, amplifier, precision rectifier, RC circuit, comparators and LEDs. Changes in volume give different output voltages, which in turn powers LEDs in a voltage ladder. The higher the sound level, the more LEDs light up. At noise levels above approximately 85 dB the last LED lights up indicating dangerous levels. The results show that this circuit can be used in different environments to easily identify harmful sounds.
